# BookingDrexel

This joint project with [Hung Do](https://github.com/DoNguyenHung) features a fake hotel website. I was responsible for the back-end tech stack, including Flask and SQLite, as well as a portion of the front-end, using JavaScript. The domain of the website has expired, but the code remains accessible in this repo.

See [database.py](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/BookingDrexel/blob/main/src/database.py) for more details regarding database implementation.

See [server.py](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/BookingDrexel/blob/main/server.py) for more details regarding routing using Flask.
